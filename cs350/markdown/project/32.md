# Lesson 32 - Design

The theme of this milestone is to release the software.
A successful release will allow external users to begin using the software.


## PROJECT

### Graded Milestones 1-5
* Checklists are updated and grades entered in Canvas
* 80% of grade is for individual contribution
* 20% of grade is for team contribution


### Contact Me for a Regrade
* If you do more work you must contact me
* Summarize what you want me to look at


### Milestone #6 - First Code Release
* Requirements Role - Resolve Issues
* Design Role - Refactoring and testing
* Code Role - Write code - core features
* Test Role - Acceptance testing
* [Milestone Details](../docs/Milestones)
        
        
### User Guide
* Before release focus on the customer experience
* App landing page
* User guide to help users understand


### Milestone 7
* Each team will demonstrate the app in class
* Students will work with the application and give feedback
* Developers will respond to the feedback
* Grading will be done based on the Issue Log



## Project Scope

### Lower Cost with Leverage
* 95% of the App is already done
* Reuse Requirements, Design, Code, Test
* Maximum Leverage = Minimum Cost
* No pay for working hard


### Project Size
* Cost driver is scope
* Limit the scope to control costs
* Use your last project as a benchmark


### Project Size - Small Project
* Completed in 100 hours of engineering over a month
* A demo application or tool of very limited scope
* One developer
* Budget $10,000
* Require Revenue of $10,000/year for 6 month break-even


### Project Size - Medium Project
* Completed in 1,000 hours of engineering over four months to a year
* An application that can support a new business
* One developer to three developers
* Budget $100,000
* Require Revenue of $100,000/year for 2 year break-even


### Project Size - Large Project
* Completed in 10,000 hours of engineering over a year
* An enterprise application capable of defining a new market segment
* Five to ten developers
* Budget $1,000,000
* Require Revenue of $1,000,000/year for 2 year break-even


### Try Limit the Project
* All customers want a million dollar project for $100K
* Do not start with a failure
* Cultivate credibility and trust
* Fire a bad client



## Design Patterns

### App = Data + Views + Test
* Start with Data Models and CRUD
* Implement Standard Views
* Create tests and code together
* Use standard application structure


### 50 Tricks to Build an App
* Learn the tricks
    * 1 hour to do
    * 1 day to learn
    
    
### Productivity
* App takes 50 tricks
* 50 days if you have to learn everything
* 50 hour is you already know


### Productivity
* 10 x difference
* Do you know the technology


### Inventory of Tricks
* Count the tricks you must learn
* Add one day for each trick
* Double the total estimate
* Compare to the last project
