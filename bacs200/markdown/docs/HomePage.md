# Home Page

Before creating a home page you must have a Github Pages repository.

Make sure you have done all the steps in [Github Pages Setup](GithubPages)


### Create New File
* Create "index.html"
* Select your repo in Github
* Create a new file
* Filename "bacs200/index.html"
* Must be all lower case

* Save as "bacs200/index.html"

<h1>BACS 200 - YOUR NAME</h1>
<p>I am learning HTML in BACS 200.</p>
<p>I hope it starts getting fun.</p>

```

### Test Your Page
* If you got the correct repo name then a website will automatically be created for you
* Run Firefox or Chrome
* Visit your page
* Mine is at [https://mark-seaman.github.io](https://mark-seaman.github.io/bacs200/index.html)
* Keep working until your page loads
* It may take a minute for the page to be published at Github
