# Lesson 28 - Test

## LEARN & BUILD

### Daily Stand-up Meeting
* Each person answers three questions
    * What did you do?
    * What will you do next?
    * What challenges are you working on?


### Development Log
* Document your daily progress
* Be methodical about your engineering
* Leave documents to show what you learned
* [Development Log](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/blob/master/docs/DevelopmentLog.md)


### Book Builder - 10-25
* Rebuild Virtual Env  (Installed Python 3.8.6)
* Add user administration
* Update Data Models (Author, Book, Chapter)

### Add user administration
* [Users accounts](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/blob/master/docs/UserAccounts.md)
* Register
* Login/logout
* Require login
* Show login info


### Update Data Models
* Testing
    * dj test
    * Basic user tests
* Known Problems
    * Author
        * Authors are currently hard code to Author 1
        * Need to create views to add and edit new authors
        * Tie author to logged in user
    *  Book
        * Works correctly
    *  Chapter
        * Tie add chapter to a specific book


### Book Builder - 10-27
* Setup Dev Context
* Rename app settings folder
* Deploy & test code
* Use View Inheritance
* Known Problems


### Setup Dev Context
* Define a script that sets up the dev environment and tools
* [start development script](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/blob/master/start)


### Rename app settings folder
* mv bookbuilder config
* Edit files (manage, asgi, wsgi, settings)
* dj test
* dj runserver


### Deploy & test code

* Test locally (auto, manual)
* Commit and push
* Pull and bounce server 
* Test remotely
* [Update Server](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/blob/master/docs/UpdateServer.md)

    
### Use View Inheritance

Create a series of templates
    
    book_theme.html
    _header.html
    _footer.html
    _navbar.html
    _user.html
    
[View Templates](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/blob/master/docs/ViewInheritance.md)


### Improve Appearance
* Use logic from Shrinking World website
    * Header with globe banner art
    * CSS stylesheet (static/shrinking-world.css)
    * Body background (static/paper.png)
    * Set text color to dark
    

### What Next?
* Remaining Tasks
* **TEST**  (current state)
    - Create tests find problems and log issues
* **FIX**  (known problems)
    - Fix known issues
* **EXTEND**  (new features)
    - Create features with tests
* **IMPROVE**  (simplify)
    - Refactor to eliminate duplication


### Testing
* Measure code coverage
* Test Book views, data


### Known Problems
* Fix Chapter edit
* Fix Book edit
* Add Book Description
* Fix favicon


### New Features
