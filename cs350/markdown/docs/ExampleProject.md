# Example Project - Book Builder


Throughout this course you will be building an application.
I will also be building an example application alongside you.
You will be able to see how an application evolves through
each milestone and what the documentation should look like
at each stage.

Study these documents and they will provide the key to 
completing your project work.  You will use this example
project to learn about the processes and tools for 
engineering.
