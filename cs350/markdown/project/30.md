# Lesson 30 - Milestone 6 - Release

## LEARN & BUILD

### Milestones
* Constraints allow you to focus
* Each milestone is a mini-project
* Each milestone requires similar effort
* Decide on specific deliverables


### Complete Before Moving On
* Don't neglect to complete every deliverable
* Balance Requirements, Design, Code, Test
* Test, Fix, Structure are often neglected


### Project Lifecycle at HP
* Based on hardware (software fits the hardware schedule)
* Investigation (15%), Lab Prototype (35%), Production Prototype(25%), Release(25%)


### How Many Milestones
* Between 4 and 7
* More means more granularity (lower risk)
* Few may mean lower overhead (higher productivity)


### Measure Velocity
* Calculate your rate of progress
* Have a complete understanding of work remaining
* Predict the end (start at 30% point in project)


### Budget Your Effort
* Schedule - when will it ship
* Resources - people, money, etc.
* Features - scope of project


### Your Project
* 4 people - 14 weeks - 9 hrs/week
* 70% learning - 30% doing
* 500 hours for team
    * 150 hours engineering 
    * 350 hours learning
* 1 month of full-time work

* Produce documents to capture knowledge
* Document every key decision
    * One sentence for each decisions
    * Decide something every hour of work
    * At least 100 items to document


### Milestone 6 - Release
* Acceptance Criteria
* Resolve All Defects
* Program Metrics
    * Code and test size
    * Defects open/closed
