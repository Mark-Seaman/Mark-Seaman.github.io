# NETIQUETTE: The Art of Communicating Online

It should go without saying that the same standards of behavior that you would 
follow in “real life” apply in an on-line course. There is no tolerance for 
unacceptable behavior or cyber bullying. Class netiquette mandates that you 
do your best to act within the normal expectations of human interaction while 
interacting with your classmates on-line.

Here are a few tips:

1. Watch how you express your emotions and humor. Due to the lack of vocal 
and nonverbal clues in online “speech, we often need something extra to read 
into a message what was intended.

2. Cultural and ability differences impact the online group—keep this in mind.

3. Think before you post—there is a human on the other side.

4. Be ethical, respectful, and courteous.

5. College level communication skills are expected in all communications. 
Use correct punctuation and spelling. No texting language. Use punctuation 
including capital letters correctly.

6. Keep your comments relative to the topic of discussion

7. Validate other’s comments, ideas, and efforts using well thought out messages. 
Simply replying “yeah”, “way to go” and other similar expressions do not 
contribute to the learning environment.

8. The use of emoticons, links, or other tool is okay so long as the above 
listed rules are followed.
