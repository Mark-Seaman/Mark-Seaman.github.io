    <title>Project 9 - Non-profit Blog


## Goals

Balance pursuing your interests with serving others.
Meaning is found by making a contribution to benefit someone else.

Select a cause worth investing in. Identify an organization that is a 
leader for that cause.

Build a one page market website for that organization. Use all of the technical and 
business skills you learned in BACS 200.

This page will be used to gather interested people and connect them to the
organization.  You must research the organization and create a marketing pitch that 
tells their vision.

Focus on producing a high-impact website that tells a compelling business story.


## Organizations
