intergalactic terrorism.  By producing Book Builder Tony Stark believes that we will disrupt
the Kree monopoly and make the universe safer.

* **Teaching Value** -
Book Builder will use the best practices in software engineering to teach students how
projects should be done.  This is include the entire software lifecyle, developer roles, 
and milestones.  The project has been divided into a grid of 28 cells 
(7 milestones x 4 roles).
Each cell in the matrix will have written documentation that can be a used as an example 
for other projects.


## Project Features

### Editorial Workflow

Each chapter goes through a series of stages:

* Outline - A strong outline fits into a master outline for the book.
* Draft - Each of the bullets in the outline is expanded into prose.
* Edit - The content is reviewed and updated for spelling, grammar, word choice, accuracy, 
and tone.
* Review - The content is ready to have external readers review it but remains in a
state of refinement.
* Published - The content is released to the public.

### User Experience
