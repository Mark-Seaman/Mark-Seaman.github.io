### Four freedoms of free software
- Stallman 1986
    * Freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
    * Freedom to study how the program works, and change it.
    * Freedom to redistribute copies to help your neighbor.

### Open Source Software
* Build on the ideas of Free Software Movement
* Reframed to be more commercially minded
* Softened the political agenda and moral philosophy
* [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) - Software, Science, Manufacturing, Media


### Famous People

### My Experience In Open Source
* Tesseract Project
* Intellectual Property


### Tesseract OCR Project
* Optical Character Recognition - image to words
* Goal - 10x accuracy on bad photocopies
* Very difficult technology
* 5 people 3 years   1989-1991   $4-5 million
* I named the project Tesseract


### Intellectual Property
* Ideas are $
* Technology 
    - Matrix matcher, Stotastic Classifier, Microfeatures, Neural Nets
    - Work matcher, Fragment Assembler, Genetic Algorithms
* Patents protect ideas
* IP lets you block competitors


### Business Interests
* Tech goal met - 10x accuracy on bad photocopies
* Biz goal - Required revenue boost - $50M
* Partners & Competitors
* Sat on shelf for 15 years
* Release to Open Source


### PyCon 2014
* Seminar "Automate receipts with Tesseract"
* 25 years later
* Now available as Text Fairy from Google


### Lessons for Open Source
* Use open source to solve problems
* Contribute value to others
* Break through old patterns of thought
* Rethink how we build the future


### Projects
* Get Value - Find software to use
* Get Involved - Contribute something back
* Get Connected - Collaborate with interesting people
* Get Famous - Do what benefits others


### Opportunity
* Find a problem
* Fix it and give it to others
* Build expertise in an area
