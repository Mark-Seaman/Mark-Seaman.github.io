[CS 350 Documents](Index.md)

    
## Team Organization
* Each student has a role
* Each student will spend 10 hours/week
* Students will take on new role at midterm

## Development Iterations
* Seven milestones - mini projects
* Student time: 10 hours/week 
* Each role has deliverables
* Team effort 80 hours/milestone
 
## Grading
* Seven milestones will be graded
* Team participation (measured by peer review)
* Team success (measured by teacher)
 
## Team Success
* Each milestone will deliver
    *     Documented requirements & client management
    *     Documented tools and process and designs
    *     Running code
    *     Tests that pass
* Each milestone will have unique criteria for success
* Team will deliver a medium-sized software application

## Delivered Value & Project Scope
* Software projects scale with the amount of effort that is invested
* Each team has four people that are expected to spend around 10 hours weekly
* Your team will invest 40 hours per week or 560 hours total
* Most of this time will be spent learning not doing
* The expectation is for each app to get 200 hours of real engineering throughout the course
* This is equivalent to one month of professional engineering
