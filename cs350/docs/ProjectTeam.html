<h2 id="development-team">Development Team</h2>
<p>The key to great teamwork is great communication. This project is done by a mythical team of engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tony Stark - Client representative</li>
<li>Natalia Romanova - Technical lead</li>
<li>Hank Pym - Back-end developer</li>
<li>Bruce Banner - Front-end developer</li>
<li>Mark Seaman - Project manager</li>
<li>Wanda Maximoff - Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Each person is given a role that matches their expertise. For each Milestone developers will commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in the two-week Development Sprint.</p>
<h2 id="communication-plan">Communication Plan</h2>
<p>The dev team is geographically distributed in the USA, Japan, and Europe. It is essential that developers meet up regularly over Zoom and occasionally in person.</p>
<p>The Book Builder team will meet MWF each week at 11:00-11:30 to coordinate project activities. Development work will be done outside of this meeting. This will serve the purpose of the &quot;Scrum Daily Stand-up Meeting&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-agenda">Meeting Agenda</h2>
<p>Project coordination meetings will occur virtually over Zoom. https://unco.zoom.us/s/7681109772 The team will meet weekly a 4:00-5:00PM MDT on Friday for project coordination.</p>
<p>In this coordination each member will answer three questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I do?</li>
<li>What am I working on next?</li>
<li>What challenges or risks are before me?</li>
</ul>
<p>This meeting is for coordination only. Developers should follow up and collaborate later with each other when they see opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="team-coordination">Team Coordination</h2>
<p>Mark Seaman will lead the meetings as &quot;Scrum Master&quot;. Tony Stark will represent the client interests to clarify the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="scrum">Scrum</h2>
<p>Milestones</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Project Plan Complete</li>
<li>Technology Proven</li>
<li>Core Features Implemented</li>
<li>Functionality Complete</li>
<li>Test Complete</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>First Upgrade</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lifecycle">Lifecycle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requirements - lead during Milestones 1-3</li>
<li>Design - lead during Milestones 2-4</li>
<li>Code - lead during Milestones 3-5</li>
<li>Test - lead during Milestones 5-7</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>
<p>Each milestone represents a development sprint, which will be a highly focused burst of energy to meet the milestone goals. Each sprint will last for two weeks.</p>
<p>During the Sprint developers will be building the next version of the product. They will be working on an explicit list of features designated by the client. All other activities will be postponed until the Sprint is complete. Features that are planned cannot change during the Sprint.</p>
<h3 id="sprint-planning-meetings">Sprint Planning meetings</h3>
<p>Each Sprint will start with a Sprint Planning Meeting. Development team will meet with the client to determine the client features with the highest priority. This will be expressed as a Product Backlog which shows the features in sorted order of importance to the client.</p>
<p>For each Milestone developers will commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in the two-week Development Sprint. Features are selected by the individual developer and must include the highest priority issues on the Product Backlog.</p>
<p>If a developer cannot deliver the required functionality then another teammate will be required to produce the missing result.</p>
<h3 id="team-survey">Team Survey</h3>
<p>After each milestone team members will give feedback about the team dynamics they experienced. A brief survey will show how the team is working together. The results of this survey will be recorded as a part of the public record for Book Builder.</p>
<p>Each team member is required to complete the survey for each milestone. Tools will act as a reminder.</p>
