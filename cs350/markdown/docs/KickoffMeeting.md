# Project Kickoff Meeting

Get together with your team (for 2 hours) and figure out the following issues.

* Application name - Come up with a name of the app you are building.  This will be used
as the project team name.  Email me with your selection by Monday.

* App Description - 
Convert your one paragraph description into a one page vision of what the application 
should do.

* Features - Think about which [features](Features) you will be implementing and how to 
build them.

* Technology - Select the technology that you will be using to build this app.  Make sure that all team 
members agree on the choice.  This will have profound implications on your success as a 
team.  The example will be built using the Python/Django/Postgres stack and I will be 
producing lots of code for that platform.  This may influence your choice.  

* Github - Decide on a Github projects strategy.  My recommendation is create an account for the
app and set up all developers as collaborators.


Gather this info and write a one page document that states your decisions.  
Send it to me by Monday so that I can review it and give you further 
guidance.
