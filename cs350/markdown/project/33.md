## Refactoring

### Code Metrics
* Lines of Code (files, product, tests)
* Issues (open, closed, test hours)
* Effort (hours of engineering)
* Design Patterns


### Lines of Code 
* Count the files
* Lines of product code
* Lines of test code

```


### Code Metrics
* 500 lines of Python Product Code
* 375 lines of HTML Template Code
* 300 lines of Python Test Code


### Complexity
* Review the largest files in the code
* Think about complexity
* How close is this to the natural complexity

### Refactoring
* Budget time for refactoring
* Seaman's Rules of Refactoring
    * Break up functions larger than 10 lines
    * Break up files larger than 200 lines
    * Eliminate any duplication of more than 3 lines
    * No more than 3 thing on one line
* Short Files, Functions, Lines, Without Duplication


### Tests Firsts
* Don't Refactor without tests
* Either test it or remove it


### Most Important Refactorings
* Move function to new file
* Rename
* Extract function
* Extract variable
