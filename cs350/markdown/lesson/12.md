# Lesson 12 - Milestone #3  - Core Features Implemented

## PROJECT GRADING

### Building Software Tools
* [App Teams](../team/Index)
* Roles for each milestone
* Working on Project Assessment Tools


### Working on Assessing Milestone 2
* Range of Capabilities
    * Advanced students
    * Struggling to connect
* Great learning opportunity for everyone


### Accommodate Learning
* Each milestone role will have specific criteria
* You will get points for the criteria you meet
* You will have till the end of the semester to complete all milestones
* [Evaluation criteria](../docs/Milestones) for the first three milestones


### Periodic Review
* As a client I will review progress on all projects
* Based on the criteria met you will be graded as a student
* Your grade will be improved as you meet additional criteria


### Teams must work together
* If one member fall others are expected to step in
* You will give me feedback about when this happens
* The project must move forward


### Example 
* Book Builder - Wanda - M1. Code - 0 points
* Book Builder - Wanda - M2. Test - 60 points
* Tony completed - M1. Code - 80 points
* Tony reports that he did the work
* Wanda gets partial credit even though M1. Code got done


### Accommodate Learning
* Good students can push forward without being held back
* Students struggling can have time to complete the work
* Help your teammates (we all win together!)
* Meet daily


### Client Feedback
* Building evaluation tools into Sensei
* Evaluation will support individual and teamwork grading
* Will begin giving client feedback
* Milestone #3
