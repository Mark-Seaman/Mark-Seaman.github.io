<p>I am excited to be teaching you in BACS 350 this year. In this very challenging time I hope that this course will be a bright spot and something that you look forward to.</p>
<p>This class has been upgraded in many ways in response to the current realities of our world. The biggest benefits you will see is a much greater flexibility in how and where you work. This is important not only to address health concerns but also to give you a very realistic work experience while you are still in school.</p>
<p>You will be able to work on the class content from anywhere at any time. All of the materials for the course content will be delivered by custom software I wrote specifically for this class. Content published on the classroom server includes notes, slides, tutorials, projects, and videos.</p>
<p>The class sessions will not be lectures, instead that time is available to get help with your projects. Each class session will be held via Zoom and students can bring their problems and I will work through them while the rest of the students watch and learn. These help sessions will be optional but very valuable to you.</p>
<p>Over the summer, extensive work has been done on the Sensei Server which provides presentation of the class content. The system is highly interactive, guiding you through the project work.</p>
<p>Internet materials will be used in place of a textbook. Weekly projects will be done to create a comprehensive medium sized commercial web app.<br />Each week you will build a project milestone that will be a development iteration moving toward the final application release. Throughout the semester these projects will teach you all of the basic skills you need to build commercial apps. The 14 projects will be due each Friday. There will be no exams and no graded reading.</p>
<p>This class will build skills that qualify you for a job developing commercial web applications.</p>
