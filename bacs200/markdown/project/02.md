# Project 2 - My Inspiration

Who inspires you to make
the world a little brighter?

Select one historical or public figure.
Describe why they inspire you and what your response is toward them and 
what they believe in.
Create an article that invites your peers to admire your hero.  Use your 
persuasion skills to
win others over.  You will be judged based strength of your writing by 
your peers.
