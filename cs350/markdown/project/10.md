# Lesson 10 - Code

### Milestone #2 - Technology Proven - Goal
* Prove that the project is doable
* Demonstrate the basic capability required
* Create a hosted application
* Show the core user story
* Create the working relationship
* High-level design 


### Milestone #2 - Code
* Deploy a simple app
* Create a prototype of the user experience
* Create data models
* Build simple test infrastructure
* Document workflow built around tests 


### Deploy a simple app
* Setup your application on your web host
* Document the steps to deploy new code
* Document to setup of the web host environment


### Create a prototype of the user experience
* Create code that shows how the app works
* Illustrate the main sequence between views
* Avoid implementing business rules
* Hardcode all text (it's just a mockup)
* Gather customer feedback


### Prototype Views
* [View Prototypes in Django](../docs/ViewPrototype)
* Create an app to illustrate the views
* Everything is fake
* Views have no style
* Show the user flow and navigation


### Use one Route to Load Different Page Templates

#### pages/views.py

    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    
    class PageView(TemplateView):
    
        def get_template_names(self):
            template_name = self.kwargs.get('template')
            return template_name
        

#### urls.py

    from django.urls import path
    from page.views import PageView
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('<str:template>', PageView.as_view()),
    ]
   
   
### Book Builder - Test-driven development workflow
* [Test-driven Development Workflow](../docs/Workflow)
* Workflow
    * Pull code
    * Feature Loop
        * Create a failing test
        * Create the code to pass the test
        * Save the test code for later
        * Commit and push changes
        * Select next feature
    * Run all tests
    * Fix all defects
    * Push code
    
    
### Deploy a simple app
* Test all code locally
* Run a console at Python Anywhere
* Pull new code
    * cd to code repo
    * git pull
* Restart server
* Browse to app page
    * [Book Builder](http://markseaman.pythonanywhere.com/)
* To debug view the error log


### Create data models

#### Book Builder Data models

Data Classes and database tables

* Reader
    * user*
* Author
    * user*
    * name
* Book
    * author*
    * title
* Chapter
    * book*
    * title
    * order
* Paragraph
    * chapter*
    * text
    * order
* Image
    * chapter*
    * src
    * alt
    * order

“*” makes a link to another table.  This is implemented 
by a foreign key relationship between the two tables.  

Example: Books have Authors so the Book data model has
a ForeignKeyField that points to the Author Model class.

#### book/models.py

bookbuilder/settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'book',
    ]

book/models.py

    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    class Author(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Book(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

Migrate the database

    python manage.py makemigrations
    
    python manage.py migrate
    
Enable the admin views

book/urls.py

    from django.urls import path
    from django.contrib import admin

    urlpatterns = [
        path(r'admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]
    

book/admin.py

    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Author, Book

    admin.site.register(Author)
    admin.site.register(Book)

Create Superuser to use admin views

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
    python manage.py runserver
    
Browse to test

    Visit http://127.0.0.1:8002/admin/
    

### Build simple test infrastructure

Not done at this time.

Document workflow built around tests 



## BUILD

### Book Builder Design
* Follow link on side menu "Book Builder"
* Link to [Code for Book Builder](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/tree/master/docs/plan/Milestone-2/Code.md)


### Milestone #2 - Code
Use this as a checklist of things to deliver

* Code View Prototype (show User Stories)
* Build database tables
* Create CRUD operations (on some tables)
* Document workflow for coding
* Deploy a running application
