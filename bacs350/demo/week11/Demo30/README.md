# View Workshop

Demonstrate Design Patterns

### 1. Workshop
* The workshop view inherits from the "theme.html" template
* It adds a menu of choices to every page
* Links go to demo pages


### 2. Container

* Add container to give better layout to any view
* Wrap the main content in a container


### 3. Grid Layout 
* Add "row" and "col"
* A row will fit items horizontally
* Start with equal width
* templates/workshop.html


### 4. Responsive Columns

* Use class "col-lg-4, col-lg-8"
* Color the first column
* Test the response to resizing the view


### 5. Card Layout

* Use class "col-lg-6" for half width
* Test the response to resizing the view
* Unequal sizes that also stack vertically


### 6. Multiple Card Layout

* Use class "col-lg-6" for half width
* Iterate over all cards
* templates/workshop.html


### 7. Columns of Cards

* Pass in a list of columns
* Each column is a list of cards
* templates/workshop.html
