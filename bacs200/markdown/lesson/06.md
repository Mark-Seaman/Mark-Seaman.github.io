### HTML Template

### HTML Doctype
* Start with a document type tag that tells that this is an HTML file.

```
        <!DOCTYPE html>
```


### HTML root element
* The top level element in HTML is <html>.   Add both the open and close.

```
        <html lang="en">
        </html>
```


### HTML head & body
* Add the head and body elements
* Add both the open and close tags for all elements
* **head** holds invisible settings for the page
* **body** holds the visible content for the page

```
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
          </head>
          <body>
          </body>
        </html>
```


### HTML body

* Add some content to the body.
* Add a headline **h1** and a paragraph with **p**

```
        <h1>Simple HTML Page</h1>
        <p>This demo shows how to create a page that contains a single headline and two paragraphs of text.</p>
        <p>HTML is not really that hard.  There are just a lot of details.</p>
```


### HTML Head

Within the **head** we will define the invisible settings that the browser will read.

These settings must be defined

* characters that are used within the page
* size of the display area
* title used for the browser tab label and bookmarks

We will add more items later.  For now we have

```
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
```


### All together now!

```
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
            <title>BACS 200 - Simple Page</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Simple HTML Page</h1>
            <p>This demo shows how to create a page that contains a single headline and two paragraphs of text.</p>
            <p>HTML is not really that hard.  There are just a lot of details.</p>
          </body>
        </html>
```
