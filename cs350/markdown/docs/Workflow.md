# Test-driven Development Workflow

### Session setup
* Developer tools setup
* Github Desktop
    * View changes
    * Commit and changes
    * Pull new code
* Run Editor
    * Use Open Folder in Brackets to remember code location
    * Remember last change made
* Run a terminal window
    * Verify the virtual environment
    * Run the server
    * Test the code
    * Fix any errors
    
    
### Workflow for Development
* Pull code
* Feature Loop (focus on one feature)
    * Create a failing test
    * Create the code to pass the test
    * Save the test code for later
    * Commit and push changes
    * Select next feature
* Run all tests
* Fix all defects
* Push code


### Implementation Tasks
Balance the time spent between the key tasks that are essential
to good engineering.

* **TEST (current state)** - Create tests to understand the problems that
exist within the current system.
* **FIX (known problems)** - Fix all known problems that you find.  Any problem
that cannot be fixed should be logged as an issue.
* **EXTEND (new features)** - Add new features one at a time with Test-Driven Development.  Execute all test frequently to guarantee quality.
* **IMPROVE (simplify)** - Refactor the software to eliminate duplication and
simplify the structure.
