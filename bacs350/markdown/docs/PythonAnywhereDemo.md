**NOTE:** In this video I fumble around with trying to activate the 
virtual environment.  Python Anywhere provides its own setup for 
activating the correct environment. 

There is a need to create the environment using

    mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.8 .venv

But there is no need to activate the environment using

    source .venv/bin/activate
