### Writing a Test Plan
* [Writing a Test Plan](../docs/TestPlan)
* Hierarchy of planning levels
* Different levels of detail
* Test plan is an outline


### Planning Levels
* Level 1 - Test Plan
* Level 2 - Test Area
* Level 3 - User Story Test
* Level 4 - Test Script
* Level 5 - Test Case


### Level 1 - Test Plan

* Testing strategy
* Testing types
    * Manual Acceptance Testing
    * Django unit test
    * Hammer test
    * Quick test
    * Page test
    * Selenium Page test


### Level 2 - Test Area

* Each major block of functionality
* Product subsystems
    * Views
    * Database
    * Order processing
    * User accounts
    * Reports
    * Diagnostics


### Level 3 - User Story Test

* Each Test Area has User Stories.  
* User Experience (UX) is documented in requirements
* Each requirement is tested
* Examples:  
    * Student Auth UX
    * Create New Book UX
    * Register Student Grade UX


### Level 4 - Test Script

* Each User Story has User Scenarios.  
* A Test Script outlines how the User Scenario will be exercised and verified.
* Examples:  Student Auth UX
    * Student can register
    * Student can login
    * Student can logout
    * Only students can see grades


### Level 5 - Test Case

* Each User Scenarios has specific features
* A Test Case tests specific behavior
* Do this, check this
* Examples:  Students can register
    * Successful registration
    * Error for bad email, name, or already enrolled
    * Student can login after registering
    * Errors prevent student from being enrolled


### Examples:
* [Sensei Student Auth](../docs/TestScriptStudentAuth)
* [Book Builder Test Plan](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Mark-Seaman.github.io/blob/master/BookBuilder/Milestone-1/Test.md)


### Book Builder Testing
* Testing will be reduced because of limited time on this project.
* Essential testing will include
    * Manual Acceptance Testing
    * Quick Tests in development
    * Page Tests (using "requests" Python package on PyTest)


### Log issues

* Product Backlog - Prioritized list of work for this milestone
* Unresolved work is logged
