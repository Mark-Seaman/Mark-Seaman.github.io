# Lesson 15 - Code

## CLASS PROJECTS

### Building Software Tools
* Finish your teamwork surveys
* [App Teams](../team/Index)
* Roles for each milestone
* Teamwork survey
* Milestone checklist
   

### Teamwork Survey
* You must complete the teamwork survey or lose points
* I will set letter grades tomorrow


### Milestone Sign-off Checklist
* Customer acceptances
* Each role and each milestone has four items to deliver
* I will assess periodically and record points for each milestone
* If you are behind catch up


### Success Required
* All projects must be successful
* Managers of teams will cancel projects that are not
* There is a minimum threshold that is required to continue
* You cannot learn by being on a failing team


### Project Team Failure
* All teams must clear Milestone 2 by Friday, Oct 2
* If a team fails to reach Milestone 2 by the deadline then it unlikely to succeed
* This will result in the project being canceled 
* Team members will be reassigned to other projects
* Milestone 4 may see new team members joining you


### Grades Reflect Your Contribution
* 80% Your Technical Contribution
* 20% Your Teamwork Contribution
* If your project fails you may still succeed
* Make your work count even if your project is canceled

### Milestone #3  - Design Role 
* Code Role - Incremental development (Sprints)
    * Select features for sprint
    * Implement the features
    * Test the features
    * Fix all defects 


### Select features for sprint
* Decide on what can be done during Milestone 3
* Commit to complete these features
* Build system incrementally


### Implement the features
* Use Design Patterns
    * Data Models
    * View Prototype
    * Data Views
    * Automated Tests
    * View Prototype Tests
    * CRUD Tests
    * Data View Tests
    
    
### TDD Workflow
* One feature at a time
* Write tests that fail
* Write minimal code to pass tests
* Repeat


### Test the features
* Combine manual tests and automatic tests
* Run tests every 10 minutes
* Tests code should be 50% of the code you write


### Fix all defects 
* Pay as you go
* Eliminate technical debt
* An issue should be created for every known problem



## Design Pattern
* Data Model Views


### Design Patterns
* Never start from scratch
* Leverage past solutions
* Build team knowledge
* Decide on the right way to do each task


### Design Pattern Template
* Name - Capture a major concept
* Context - When can I use this
* Simplest Solution - Quick win
* Variations - What can I do differently?
* Limitations - Constraints and issues


### Design Pattern Name
* Name - Capture a major concept
* Data Model Views Pattern
* Build views for all CRUD operations
    * Supports CREATE using CreateView
    * Supports READ using ListView
    * Supports READ using DetailView
    * Supports UPDATE using UpdateView
    * Supports DELETE using DeleteView


### Design Pattern Context
* Context - When can I use this?
* Django data models defined using 'django.db.models.Model'
* Need a simple set of views that can be expanded later


### Design Pattern Simple Solution
* Simplest Solution - Quick win
* Fewest lines of code possible
* Documented running example 
* Recreate running code in less that five minutes
* [W3Schools Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_json)


### Design Pattern Variations - What can I do differently?
* Variations - What can I do differently?
* Describe things that have been anticipated
* What flexibility is already built in


### Design Pattern Limitations - Constraints and issues
* Limitations - Constraints and issues
* Describe things that have NOT been anticipated
* Problems that must be overcome
* Logical extensions to build
* Reasons not to use this pattern


### Data Model Views Pattern Solution
* Build views for all CRUD operations
* Supports CREATE using CreateView
* Supports READ using ListView
* Supports READ using DetailView
* Supports UPDATE using UpdateView
* Supports DELETE using DeleteView


### Data Model Views Pattern Solution
* Collection of specific patterns
    * Data Model Design Pattern
    * CreateView Design Pattern
    * ListView Design Pattern
    * DetailView Design Pattern
    * UpdateView Design Pattern
    * DeleteView Design Pattern


### Using a Design Pattern
* Using a well-designed pattern should take 1-2 hours
* Copy the code
* Run the demo and debug any issues you find
* Make a series of incremental changes using test driven development


### Creating Your Own Pattern
* You must have 100 hours of experience to create a pattern
* Requires applying the pattern at least 10 times
* Collect patterns from others
* Build a library of design patterns



## Blog Demo Code

### Blog Demo
* Simple app that shows the Data View Design Pattern
* Copy this code and debug it
* Make changes to make it match your problem
* [Blog App](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Book-Builder/tree/master/BlogApp)


### Data Model Design Pattern 

blog/models.py

    from django.db import models
    
    class Post(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        author = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        body = models.TextField()
    

### CreateView Design Pattern 

templates/post_new.html

```

    <form action="" method="post">{% csrf_token %}
       {{ form.as_p }}
       <input type="submit" value="Save">
    </form>
```


blog/urls.py

    from django.urls import path
    from .views import BlogCreateView
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('new/', BlogCreateView.as_view(), name='post_new'),
    ]

blog/views.py
        
    class BlogCreateView(CreateView):
        model = Post
        template_name = 'post_new.html'
        fields = ['title', 'author', 'body']
    

### ListView Design Pattern 

templates/post_list.html

```
    {% for post in object_list %}
        <h3><a href="{% url 'post_detail' post.pk %}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
        <p>{{ post.body }}</p>
    {% endfor %}
```   

blog/urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', BlogListView.as_view(), name='post_list'),
    ]
    
blog/views.py

    class BlogListView(ListView):
        model = Post
        template_name = 'post_list.html'
    

### DetailView Design Pattern 

templates/post_detail.html

```   
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.body }}</p>
    
    <a href="{% url 'post_edit' post.pk %}">Edit Blog Post</a>
    <a href="{% url 'post_delete' post.pk %}">Delete Blog Post</a>
``` 

blog/urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>/', BlogDetailView.as_view(), name='post_detail'),
    ]

blog/views.py

    class BlogDetailView(DetailView):
        model = Post
        template_name = 'post_detail.html'
    


### UpdateView Design Pattern

templates/post_edit.html

```
    <form action="" method="post">{% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <input type="submit" value="Update">
    </form>
```

blog/urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>/edit/', BlogUpdateView.as_view(), name='post_edit'),
    ]

blog/views.py

    class BlogUpdateView(UpdateView):
        model = Post
        template_name = 'post_edit.html'
        fields = ['title', 'body']
    
    

### DeleteView Design Pattern

templates/post_delete.html

```
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.body }}</p>
    
    <a href="{% url 'post_edit' post.pk %}">Edit Blog Post</a>
    <a href="{% url 'post_delete' post.pk %}">Delete Blog Post</a>
```

blog/urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>/delete/', BlogDeleteView.as_view(), name='post_delete'),
    ]

blog/views.py

    from django.urls import reverse_lazy

    class BlogDeleteView(DeleteView):
        model = Post
        template_name = 'post_delete.html'
        success_url = reverse_lazy('post_list')
