# Lesson 2 - Django Projects & Apps

## LEARN

### Class Interactions
* Face to face is not possible
* Use the richest communication channel you can
* Message 7%, Tone of voice 38%, Non-verbal queues 55%
* Turn on your camera if you have one


### Reading - Django for Beginners
* Chapter 2 - Hello World App
* Reading uses "pipenv" - I use "pip"


### Zoom Recordings

* Each session will be recorded for your education
* Use this page to see how to get to the live sessions and office hours

### Github
* Github is the best version control service available
* It is a web service that hosts thousands of users and millions of projects
* By January 2020 - 40 million users, over 100 million repositories


### Git
* Invented by the creator of Linux
* Save every version of every file
* Work individually or with thousands of developers
* Put everything under version control


### Using Github
* All assignments will be completed using Github
* Github Pages can be used as a web server for static pages
* All pages you create will be published automatically from your Github repository


### Github Desktop
* Github Desktop is the software app that you will use to help you work with local files.


### Virtual Environments
* You may need many different Python environments for different packages
* Each environment may use different packages
* Python provide Virtual Environments to isolate projects from each other


### Activate Virtual Environment
* All work in Python should be done in a VENV
* Each work session starts by activating the environment
* See [Setup Development Environment](/course/bacs350/docs/SetupPython) for details


### Install Django
* pip list --- should have django 3.1
* pip install django==3.1



## BUILD

### Development Workflow
* Edit - make a small (1-3 lines) change to your code
* Test - run the server and browse to page
* Commit - commit changes every hour
* Repeat - work in small iteration, don't ignore bugs


### Tiled Windows
* Editor - Brackets
* Terminal - Run Django Server and file commands
* Browser - Instructions, Test Page, Github, BACS 350

* View functions
* Class view


### Create URL route
* urls.py
* Run web server
* Browse web page


### Screenshots
* Show your server log
* Show your browser window
* commit your images to Github repo


### Demo Code in Github
* Mark-Seaman/UNC-BACS-350
* Look at my code after you create your own
* You learn by doing - practice makes perfect


### Practice Exercise
* I showed you how to build a simple page
* You learn by doing
* Create multiple pages with templates
* Home, About, Our Vision, Our Strategy
* Add some simple text and hyperlinks


### Help With Setup
* Help student one at a time
