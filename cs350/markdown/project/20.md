## LEARN

### Milestone #4 - Functionality Complete
* Requirements Role * Team coordinator
* Design Role * Refactoring and code structure
* Code Role * Write code - core features
* Test Role * Continuous integration


### Design Role
* Refactoring and code structure
* Document Existing Design Patterns
* Draw diagram of code structure
* Document key APIs
* Build import/export for data


### Refactoring and code structure
* Code naturally decays
* Over time code becomes unusable
* Refactoring is required to improve structure
* Simplify - Complexity is the enemy
* Eliminate duplication


### Refactoring
* Always have automated tests
* Look for a bad smell and fix it
* Repeat until you don't smell anything

* [Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcSh-yXaXVs)


### Document Existing Design Patterns
* Design patterns encapsulate knowledge
* Standard solution to common problem
* Huge leverage of design and code
* Stand on the shoulders of others


### Design Pattern Examples
* [CRUD Views](../docs/DjangoDataViews)
* [View Prototype](../docs/ViewPrototype)
* [Test-Driven Workflow](../docs/TestDriven)
* [Test Plan](../docs/TestPlan)


### Draw diagram of code structure
* A simple picture can create immediate understanding
* Show the main concepts in your diagram
* Limit the details shown


### Document key APIs
* Capture the info that flows across the borders
* Create naming conventions with symmetry
* Design APIs with common patterns
    * Open, Read/Write, Close
    * Create, Read, Update, Delete
    * Input, Process, Output
    * Verb-Noun


### Build import/export for data
* Consider exporting data from your system
* Can this data to imported?
* How can this be used to benefit the product goals?
