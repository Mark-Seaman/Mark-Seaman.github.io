## Software Engineering Roles

Software Engineering Roles - Shrinking World Project Template


## Requirements

### Development Plan
* Project planning (flexibility to match reality)
* Priorities (Time, Money, Functionality)
* Cost and Scope (set initial expectations)
* User Stories (define the problem & solution)

### Product Milestones
* Lifecycle
* Customer Interaction
* Milestones
* Flexible planning

### Sprint Planning 
* Customer meeting
* Planning summary
* Demo & product backlog
* Sprint features history

### Issues List
* Technical Debt
* Issue List - tracking unsolved problems
* Risk Weighting Model
* Estimating Release Date (Velocity, Burn-down Graph, Release)
## Design

### Technology Plan
* Selection of Technology
* Platforms, frameworks, services
* Tools
* Learning required

### Architecture
* Data and Control Flow
* Component Design
* Top Five Challenges - risk & debt
* Design documents

### Detailed Design
* Apps = Views + Data + I/O
* Test Strategy
* Design Patterns
* Prototyping

### Prototype Core Features
* Stand-alone Code Fragments
* Technical Tricks
* Best Practices
* Hierarchy of requirements


## Code

### Test-driven Development
* Work the feature hierarchy
* Test before code
* One feature at a time
* Build a suite of tests
* Debug - Expanding and collapsing the scope

### Version Control
* Simple git - status and deploy
* Rebuild from repos
* Deploy using git pull
* Branches & Pull Request

### Code Editing
* Editor vs. IDE
* Refactoring - simple with no duplication
* Code reuse
* Measure progress daily
* Update the plan weekly

### Tracking progress
* Update issue list - add new knowledge
* Measure work remaining (weighted issues)
* Velocity (based on work completed)
* Burn-down Graph
* Estimated completion date


## Test

### Test Planning
* Issue tracking
* Measure test coverage
* Type of testing
* Testing Workflow

### Unit Tests
* Isolate components
* Assert
* Unit test framework
* Test every feature

### System Tests
* Integrated system
* Test all scenarios
* Testing with Data
* Data fixtures

### Acceptance Tests
* Customer Acceptance
* Release criteria checklist
* Release frequency
* Final testing

### Devops
* Release planning
* Web hosting
* Automation & testing
* Platform updates
