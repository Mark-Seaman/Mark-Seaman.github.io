<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Author Value</strong> - Create the most productive tool for authors to write non-fiction books. Apply advanced technology to allow authors to focus on the creative content, rather than the mechanical process of computer and administrative work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Value</strong> - Create application software that is capable of supporting a commercial publishing operation. When this project is complete a business plan we be developed to get paying customers for Book Builder. The desire is to have an established company buy the Book Builder product. The current publishing monopoly controlled by the Kree is widely believed to be supporting intergalactic terrorism. By producing Book Builder Tony Stark believes that we will disrupt the Kree monopoly and make the universe safer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching Value</strong> - Book Builder will use the best practices in software engineering to teach students how projects should be done. This is include the entire software lifecyle, developer roles, and milestones. The project has been divided into a grid of 28 cells (7 milestones x 4 roles). Each cell in the matrix will have written documentation that can be a used as an example for other projects.</p></li>

<h2 id="project-features">Project Features</h2>
<h3 id="editorial-workflow">Editorial Workflow</h3>
<p>Each chapter goes through a series of stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outline - A strong outline fits into a master outline for the book.</li>
<li>Draft - Each of the bullets in the outline is expanded into prose.</li>
<li>Edit - The content is reviewed and updated for spelling, grammar, word choice, accuracy, and tone.</li>
<li>Review - The content is ready to have external readers review it but remains in a state of refinement.</li>
<li>Published - The content is released to the public.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-experience">User Experience</h3>
<p>Author can create book projects, outlines, chapters, text, images, cover artwork, and other items needed for the book.</p>
<h3 id="kindle-book">Kindle Book</h3>
<p>At any time an HTML file and the assets needed can be generated from the content that the author has created. This HTML file can be directly uploaded to Amazon as a Kindle book.</p>
<h3 id="reading-room">Reading Room</h3>
<p>The ebook version of the content is displayed on the Book Builder website within the READING ROOM. This offers a display showcase for authors to present their works and gives reader an alternative to the Kindle book format.</p>
