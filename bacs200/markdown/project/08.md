### Business Blog

During this project you will create a business blog that discusses  a complex

Select one of the current controversies:

* Response to Pandemic
* Long Term Stock Exchange
* Free Elections
* Immigration Reform
* Wealth Inequality
* Social Media and Extremism
* Social Justice Inequality
* Climate Change

We live in a day of extremism, when our ability to have a civil debate is at an
all-time low.  You will research an important topic to understand the social, 
economic, and political implications.

You will write a thoughtful article for your blog that presents a point of view 
and persuades others to adopt your view without resorting to slogans or clich√©s.

Discuss both sides of the debate (Pro and Con).  Create a great headline and three
subheadings: Social implications, Economic implications, Political implications, 
Conclusion.
Provide 100 words on each area.
