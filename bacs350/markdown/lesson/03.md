# Lesson 3 - Static Media

## LEARN

### Classroom Interactions
* Use your camera so that I can see you react
* Otherwise I'm teaching blind


### Reading - Django for Beginners
* Chapter 2 - Hello World App
* Reading uses "pipenv" - I use "pip"


### Zoom Recordings

<a href="/course/bacs350/docs/ZoomLectures" class="unc-button">Lecture</a>

* Each session will be recorded for your education
* Use this page to see how to get to the live sessions and office hours
* Lesson 2 failed to record


### Today's Agenda
* Explain how Django apps are structured
* Demonstrate project workflow
* Introduce Views, Routes, Templates


### Pages have four items to create
* URL Routes - which pages are handled
* Views - format the response for the request
* Templates - HTML content in the page
* Data Models (if using a database)


### HTML Templates
* Templates can be defined to hold all the HTML content
* The Template Loader must be defined in settings.py


### Pages may Contain Images
* Django serves pages expected to be processed
* Static content is passed directly through without processing
* Django contains a static server that can be enabled


### settings.py
* STATIC_URL = '/static/'
* STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]


### Images, CSS, Javascript
* < img src='/static/img/treetops.200.jpg' >
* < link rel='stylesheet' href='/static/unc.css' >
* < script href='/static/wow.js' >

### Demo Code in Github
* [Mark-Seaman/UNC-BACS-350](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/UNC-BACS-350/tree/master/demo/week01/app3)
* Look at my code after you create your own
* You learn by doing - practice makes perfect


### Practice Exercise

* You learn by doing
* Add images and stylesheets to each page template

* Add some simple text and hyperlinks


### Go Through the README Files
* Do the steps in each file
* You learn by doing - practice makes perfect
