# Lesson 39 - Static Website Generator


## COURSE WEBSITE

### Internet - Clients and Servers
Computers and phones request content from web servers

* Dynamic servers have a database
* Static servers return files


### Sensei Server
* Uses dynamic content from database
* Student list, student servers, URL Game, Test pages
* Every page is generated on request
* Must be hosted with the database


### Static Site
* Contains only HTML, CSS, Javascript
* No server-side logic (eg. Database, or code conversion)
* Server is only a directory of files


### Static Site Generator
* Convert dynamic web pages into static web pages
* Avoid any dynamic logic in pages
* Save files in a Git repo
