# Github Pages
 
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way 
to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can 
then modify your GitHub Pages content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.

### Automatic Web Hosting

Github Pages provides free web hosting directly from the Git Repo.  Changes made to your files
are automatically published on the internet.

To make this magic work you must name your repository with a special name.  Github sees this name
and publishes your pages without any extra work on your part.

NOTE:  In previous classes of BACS 200 students were required to sign up for web hosting at Bluehost.com
for about $60 for one year.  Github Pages are free and available to you through your Github account.


### Login to Your Github Account

If you do not have a [Github Account](GithubAccount) then take care of that first.

Note your Github User Name.   Mine is "Mark-Seaman".


### Create your first repo
* Your Github Pages will be published only if you create a repo named "username.github.io" where
"username" matches your Github user.  For example, my repo name is "Mark-Seaman.github.io".
* Create a repository based on the account name
* Example:  
    * User:  **Mark-Seaman**
    * Github URL: **https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Mark-Seaman.io**
* Use your account name
* Be careful to create the correct repository name
