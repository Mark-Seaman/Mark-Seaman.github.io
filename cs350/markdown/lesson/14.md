# Lesson 14 - Design

## PROJECT GRADING

### Building Software Tools
* [App Teams](../team/Index)
* Roles for each milestone
* Working on Project Assessment Tools
   

### Teamwork Survey
* Created tool to gather teamwork info
* Complete your surveys today for Milestone 1
* On Friday I will release the Milestone 2 survey
* After I collect data I will be assigning letter grades for Teamwork


### Milestone Engineering Checklist
* Working on a tool to record completed requirements for each milestone
* Grades will be set after the tool is in place
* Hoping to use it over the weekend for Milestones 1 & 2



## Milestone #3

### Milestone #3 - Core Features Implemented

* Requirements Role - Functional requirements
    * Issues for missing requirements
    * Product Backlog
    * Plan User Stories
    * Customer review 
* Design Role - Component Design
    * Prototype - development spike of core functionality
    * Implement data models
    * Implement views
    * Implement URL routes
* Code Role - Incremental development (Sprints)
    * Select features for sprint
    * Implement the features
    * Test the features
    * Fix all defects 
* Test Role - Automated testing
    * Workflow for TDD
    * Unit testing
    * System testing
    * Code coverage of tests 


### Milestone #3  - Design Role 
* Component Design
    * Prototype - development spike of core functionality
    * Implement data models
    * Implement views
    * Implement URL routes


### Component Design & API
* Document the high level design
* Add more details for each of the parts of the system
* Create prototype code
* Document development practices and design patterns


###  Prototype - development spike of core functionality
* Pick one core set of features
* It should be critical to the functionality
* Build a complete but simple prototype
* Use TDD practices


###  Implement data models
* Implement access functions for each data type
* Eg. Book Builder - Author, Book, Chapter, Paragraph
* Create automatic tests for Model, Create, Read, Update, Delete
* Execute all tests frequently


###  Implement views
* Implements views for each data type
* List, Detail, Edit, Add, Delete
* Create automatic tests for each view
* Document which views are needed


### Implement URL routes
* Build out page navigation
* Decide on how different views with be combined
* Build URL Routes to support the User Experience


### Document the Engineering Practices
* Design the way everyone else works
* Document the rules for TDD
* Document design patterns
