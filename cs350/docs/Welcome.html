<p>I am excited to be teaching you in CS 350 this year. In this very challenging time I hope that this course will be a bright spot and something that you look forward to.</p>
<p>This class has been upgraded in many ways in response to the current realities of our world. The biggest benefits you will see is a much greater flexibility in how and where you work. This is important not only to address health concerns but also to give you a very realistic work experience while you are still in school.</p>
<p>You will be able to work on the class content from anywhere at any time. All of the materials for the course content will be delivered by custom software I wrote specifically for this class. Content published on the classroom server includes notes, slides, tutorials, projects, and videos.</p>
<p>Over the summer, extensive work has been done on the Sensei Server which provides presentation of the class content. The system is highly interactive, guiding you through the project work.</p>
<p>Software Engineers possess two main types of knowledge: Technology and Engineering. Technology skills are tactical and tied to specific tools, languages, and frameworks. This knowledge is easily acquired and needs to be replace frequently.</p>
<p>CS350 deals with Engineering knowledge. Many engineers fail to deliver because they do not understand the key issues beyond the technology. This class will focus on tools, techniques, and software process that will make you a great engineer.</p>
<p>During the course you will be part of a team of four that build a medium-sized commercial app. The focus will be on teamwork and how you work with others to build a non-trivial software project. The big project will be delivered in a set of seven milestones.</p>
<p>The software lifecycle has four phases (Requirements, Design, Code, Test). Each team member will be assigned a role for each of the milestones. Responsibilities will rotate throughout the semester so that gain exposure to all of the roles.</p>
<p>Teamwork is essential and big part of your success will be tied to how well you work with others. Each milestone will conclude with an evaluation of the work done by each team member. Each two weeks the milestone will be weighed against the requirements and you will receive a grade.</p>
<p>The class session times will be used to schedule review sessions with each team individually. Each team member is required to participate in these sessions. Each student is also required to schedule regular time to meet with their team.</p>
<p>Internet materials will be used in place of a textbook. I will also provide a copy of my book on software engineer free to all students. There will be no exams, quizzes, or homework, and no graded reading.</p>
<p>This class will build skills that qualify you for a job developing commercial software.</p>
