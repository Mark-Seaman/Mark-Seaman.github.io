## Book Builder - Project Charter

Book Builder is a software application that runs in the cloud and on mobile devices. 
Registered users can author materials for books being written.  Authors can create new
book projects, chapters, emedded images, and front matter.  

There are also tools that support the creative process for the author.  A complete content
outline can be used to generate the Table of Contents and all of the chapter structure. 
The software presents the chapters under development within an editorial process worflow.


### Business proposition

Why do this project?  What is the true benefit?


#### Client

Tony Stark of Stark Enterprises has contracted Shrinking World to build an application
that will allow authors to rapidly construct and publish ebooks online.

#### Author Value

Create the most productive tool for authors to write non-fiction books. Apply advanced
technology to allow authors to focus on the creative content, rather than the mechanical
process of computer and administrative work.

#### Business Value

Create application software that is capable of supporting a commercial publishing operation.
When this project is complete a business plan we be developed to get paying customers for
Book Builder.  The desire is to have an established company buy the Book Builder product.

The current publishing monopoly controlled by the Kree is widely believed to be supporting
intergalactic terrorism.  By producing Book Builder Tony Stark believes that we will disrupt
the Kree monopoly and make the universe safer.

#### Teaching Value

Book Builder will use the best practices in software engineering to teach students how
projects should be done.  This is include the entire software lifecyle, developer roles, 
and milestones.  The project has been divided into a grid of 28 cells 
(7 milestones x 4 roles).
Each cell in the matrix will have written documentation that can be a used as an example 
for other projects.


### Project scope & budget

What will we build and how much will it cost?


#### Schedule, Money, Features

There are three primary priorities that define the scope of a software project.  It is 
important to establish the priority of each of these.  

#### Book Builder Priorities

1. Schedule - This entire must be completed by December 4, 2020 in order to be used for the
UNC classes.
2. Money - This project will be the individual work of Mark Seaman so no actual money will
be spent.  However, the budget can be measured in opportunity costs.  This project will
require about 100 hours of effort since many of the product features have been created for
other projects.  Mark's time is valued at $100/hour, making the project budget $10,000.
3. Features - Three tiers of features will be defined. Essential features define the 
Minimum Viable Product. Required features mark the Minimum Desirable Project.  Desired 
features define the Luxury Project.

Note the priorities - Schedule will never move, and Money will move only to protect 
the schedule.  Features will be adjusted throughout the milestone and must be constantly
negotiated with the client.
